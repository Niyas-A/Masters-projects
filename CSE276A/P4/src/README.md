# README
We implemented the core of hw3_solution in hw3_sol.py. We reuse the hw1 solution staff solution along with the april tag detection logic from hw2. We also provide a logging module for visualizationa and for experiment tracking.

We wrote all the a_star code in a_star.py. We also did some waypoint reduction code in order to reduce the number of waypoints processed.
